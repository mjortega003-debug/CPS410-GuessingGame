# CPS410-GuessingGame

Development Process:
The development process for the number guessing game begins with identifying the requirements. The main goal of the program is to create an interactive game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it. From there, the design stage involves deciding on the basic structure of the program, such as using the Random class to generate a random number, the Scanner to read user input, a loop to allow multiple attempts, and conditional statements to provide feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. Once the design is clear, the implementation phase consists of writing the code step by step, which generates the random number, prompting the user for input, comparing the guess with the target number, and providing feedback until the correct guess is made. An attempted counter is also included to track how many guesses it takes the user to succeed. After implementation, the program must be tested with different cases, such as entering guesses that are too low, too high, or correct, as well as edge values like 1 and 100, to ensure the logic works properly. During the debugging and refinement phase, syntax issues such as missing semicolons are corrected, and improvements may be added to handle invalid input or enhance the user experience. Finally, once testing confirms that the program runs smoothly, the code is polished with clear formatting and comments, and resources like the Scanner are properly closed. This structured process ensures that the program is developed logically, tested thoroughly, and refined into a complete and user-friendly game.

Challenges Faced:
We had challenges both with deciding how to begin the project.
We had trouble deciding how to evenly divide the work since the concept of creating the game seemed so simple and quick.

How We Solved Them:
We were able to solve these issues by dividing the work and alternating roles. One person began coding initial functionality and the second person picked it up, tested it, and implemented new fixes and features. In the meantime, the one not coding could add to the documentation.
We decided to add to the code bit by bit until we had a complete program. That way we both had the opportunity to review each other's code, add and adjust code where necessary,and fix any codes that persisted.

Reflection: Reflect on how pair programming influenced your problem-solving skills and contributed to the overall quality of your project, and be sure to discuss any real-life experiences that relate to teamwork in software development.


Pair programming has influenced our problem-solving skills and contributed to the overall quality of our project by allowing us to work together and collaborate on our ideas. It also allowed us to review each other’s code and check for bugs in order to ensure accuracy and limit as many errors as possible. This project relates to real-life experiences in software development as software engineer and many individuals working in the Computer Science field often need to collaborate with each other on certain tasks, whether it’s exchanging code or working together on projects. So, it is useful to be comfortable and have experience with working with others easily in order to successfully complete assignments.
